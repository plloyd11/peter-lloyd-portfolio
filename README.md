# Peter Lloyd Portfolio

Single page portfolio site built with Eleventy and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- Build sites faster with the power of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and SCSS
- [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/basic-example) (Webpack) to watch, concatenate and compile styles and scripts
- HTML minifier
- Purgecss for removing unused CSS
- ES6 support with Babel
- SEO friendly pages (including Open Graph and Twitter meta)
- Image lazyloading
- A simple blog with categories and featured images

## Requirements

Node `>=` v8.9.0

## Installation

```
npm install
```

To start the development server (and Mix), run the `npm run dev` command in terminal. Eleventy has hot reloading baked in and will automatically watch your template files for changes. Mix will watch any changes to the JS and SCSS files.

## Folder Structure

The `site` folder contains all the templates, partials and content - which Eleventy will parse into HTML for us.

Within our `site` folder, lives a `globals` folder. Here you'll find a `site.json` file - for general config stuff e.g site name, author, email, social media links etc.

You'll also find a `navigation.json` file, which we use to loop over in our nav partial to generate our navigation. There's also a `helpers.js` file, which just contains a simple environment helper.

Uncompiled SCSS and JS reside in the `resources` folder - as mentioned above, Mix will be watching these folders for any changes (you should restart the server when creating new partials/folders).

In development mode, Skeleventy will reference `main.css` for it's stylesheet. This will be pretty chunky in filesize (around 800KB!), due to the amount of Tailwind utility classes - but don't worry, Skeleventy has you covered!

## Ready to deploy

Type the `npm run production` command to minify scripts, styles and run Purgecss.

Purge will cross reference your templates/HTML with all those Tailwind classes and will remove any classes you haven't used - pretty cool huh?

Skeleventy will now reference `main.min.css` as the new stylesheet (annoyingly, Mix also minifies `main.css` as well - this bugs the hell out of me!).
